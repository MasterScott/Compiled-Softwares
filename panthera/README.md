# Programming
1. Panthera written in Python, Perl, Bash, Awk, Sed combined with power of native applications metasploit, nmap, unix utils 

# What is Panthera?
1. Panthera is a collection of scripts and codings in Perl and Python for all DNS related attacks
2. Panthera is also designed to enumerate DNS and DNS pointing Sub Domains with websites using OSINT rather waiting for apis. Panthera have built in file list which is collected from top sources like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and Ask, Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, Robtex, ReverseDNS, etc and only naming a few.
2. It eliminate duplicates, shows only common names found on actual domains rather wasting time and also gives recorded results of DNS pointed Sub Domains which could be wildcard alterted.
3. Panther can perform DNS banner grabbing
4. Panthera gives 100% accurate results.
5. Panthera can give third party visited requests from Dns 
6. Panthera can give Dns Zone Transfers, AXFR
7. Panthera can give you Dns Txt and Dns spoofing information
8. Panthera can perform cache, recursion of DNS
9. Panthera can perform DNS pointing to Sub Domains
10. Panthera can point wild card enteries domain using DNS brute
11. Panthera can perform DDOS using Dns spoofed packets to victim causing amplification and load on victim
12. Panthera have Dns cache poisoning capability for powerful web spoofing
13. Panthera have ability to scan CNAME and Aliases, in net block to expose domain hijack vulnerabilities in seconds

# How requests are handled?
1. Web requests are automatically handled by Perl modules.
2. Web requests are automatically handled by Python modules.
3. Web requests are automatically handled by Bash, Awk and Sed scripting modules.

# How DNS requests are handled?
1. The tool is designed to listen on TCP or UDP ports (default is port 53) for incoming requests and forward those requests when necessary to deal with real DNS server over UDP.
2. Scappy can handle DNS queries automatically and more  accurately
3. This tool can ONLY be used as domain name records forge
