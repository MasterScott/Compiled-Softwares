# F.A.Q

# Gateway Hack 
1. ICMP - Victim Host Redirector
2. You can redirect victim host gateway from old to new to your own

# TCP-IP-Session-Hijacker
1. Advanced TCP-IP session hijacker for any purpose, it can intrude into any unencrypted protocols and execute data payload using target credentials stealthly

# What is TCP-IP Connection Intruder & Gateway Hack & TCP-IP Connection Reset?
1. It works in NETWORK SWITCHES & HUBS stealthly!
2. Gateway works in Network Switches and Hubs Sealthly!
3. TCP reset kills a TCP connection. When used as designed, this can be a useful tool!


# TCP-IP Session Attack Method
1. At the establishment of a TCP session the client starts by sending a SYN-packet (SYN=synchronize) with an sequence number.
This number is used to assure the transmission of packets in a chronological order. It is increased by one with each packet.
The both sides of the connection wait for an packet with a specified sequence number. The first seq-number for both directions is random.
2. The server responds with an SYN/ACK packet (ACK-acknowledgment) which contains the seq-number of the client+1 and also a own start seq-number. The client confirm everything with an ACK packet including the seq-number of the server+1, after that the session is established.

                +---+       syn seq=x       +---+
                | C | ------------------->  | S |
                | L |                       | E |
                | I |   syn ack=x+1 seq=y   | R |
                | E | <-------------------- | V |
                | N |                       | E |
                | T |    ack=y+1 seq=x+1    | R |
                +---+ --------------------> +---+
                                
3. To hijack a session it is required to send a packet with a right seq-number

# TCP-IP Attack Power
1. This is where this software come to hijack any TCP-IP Session to inject payload full stealthily.
2. This software use TCP Segments can do multiple things at the same time. Byte stream data provided by applications are sliced into different chunks called segments and are delivered to receiver separately
3. One single segment carry data along with acknowledgement of another segment. A TCP segment is made of different fields which carry different meanings.
4. Segment, packets also has its own fields (headers). Packet is nothing but a segment sitting inside. Packet ads its own fields on top of the segment.
5. The important fields added on top of segments while creating a packet in network layer are mentioned below: 
    •    Source IP Address
    •    Destination IP Address
    •    TTL
    •    Identification
    •    Flags
    •    Checksum
    
# How is it different from MAN IN THE MIDDLE attack?
1. ARP uses Frame
2. Frame is if you want to deliver a message to another machine on a network, it will first search for the physical address of the destination. There is actually something called as ARP, that does the job of translating IP addresses to Physical addresses. ARP(address resolution protocol) is one of the core components in networking.


# How requests are handled?
1. Web requests are automatically handled by Perl modules.

# Payload
1. TELNET payload is included, as "haroon:hacker" as user/pass for TELNET sessions
2. FTP payload can be added as "useradd haroon passwd hacker" 
3. SMTP payload can be add
4. HTTP specific payload can be add like increasing/adding user or doing something cool with specific parameter

# Increasing Payload
1. Currently, I have injected payload in data section specifically for TELNET sessions running in UNIX platforms
2. When successfully authenitcated as victim, it will automatically add haroon:hacker as user/pass for TELNET sessions
3. More paylaods for HTTP/ FTP/ POP3/ SMTP/ TELNET, can be added in data inject command section
4. It can hack plain HTTP protocols using in banks or open area, 
5. It can hack subdomains plain HTTP, be creative! 

# Error Handling Capability
1. It have built-in capability and I don't think any naive will able to use this software

# Advantages of TCP-IP Connection Intruder
1. It is fully automatic, it doesn't want user to wait and output false positive information but it fully provide useful 
information or no information at all without wasting time
2. It is false negative and false positive free.
3. It is fully powered by Perl
5. Secure your network switches and hubs and understand how this software can inject anything in seconds without
alarming any piece of firewall or IDS

# How-to use it?
1. You should be root in Debian/Kali

# Windows & Kali Edition
1. Use on Windows or Kali
